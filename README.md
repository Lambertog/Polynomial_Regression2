# Polynomial_Regression2
A polynomial regression model is a machine learning model that can capture non-linear relationships between variables by fitting a non-linear regression line, which may not be possible with simple linear regression. It is used when linear regression models may not adequately capture the complexity of the relationship. www.analyticsvidhya.com
