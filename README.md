# Polynomial_Regression

### Summary of the analysis
In this project, different techniques and methods were explored to predict the the amount of charges an insurance company would issue to an individual based on ['age', 'sex', 'bmi', 'children', 'smoker', and 'region'] . We tried to make sense out of the use of polynomial regression , Ridge and Lasso regressions. Indeed,polynomial regression performed best amongst the three models. With the final result, a general template can be made in same manner with our regression analysis respository using the prediciting features in this case of an issurance company.
