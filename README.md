# Polynomial_Regression

### Summary of the analysis
Different techniques and methods of variable separations were used in exploring and predicting what an individual pays or would pay for insurance based on ['age', 'sex', 'bmi', 'children', 'smoker', and 'region'] of the individual. We tried to make sense out of the dataset by comparing polynomial regression , Ridge and Lasso regressions. Considering error values for both the training and testing data, polynomial regression performed best amongst the three models. With the final result, a general template can be made in same manner with our previous regression analysis respository using the prediciting features in this case 'age', 'sex', 'bmi', 'children', 'smoker', and 'region' of any individual.

### General description
A polynomial regression model is a machine learning model that can capture non-linear relationships between variables by fitting a non-linear regression line, which may not be possible with simple linear regression. It is used when linear regression models may not adequately capture the complexity of the relationship. www.analyticsvidhya.com
